* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn
## Project Motivation
This project is about at how to choose where to stay when traveling to New York based on Airbnb dataset. The project a simple regression model that predicts price based on different factors. I’m interested to work on this project because I want to work on the Business and data understanding and finally to develop regression model. </br>
## File Descriptions 
**Business Understanding**</br>
Things to be consider when you choose where to stay when you are traveling to New York, such as:
-Which neighborhood group has an affordable price?
-Where to stay in New York?
-Availability of Room service?</br?
## Data understanding 
Data preparation and cleansing process has been done to develop model.</br>
**Loading the dataset**</br>
The dataset I will use for the development of predication model is available on https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.</br>
**Data Visualization**</br>
* Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization </br>
## Modeling 
Linear regression model is develop to predict the price.</br>
**Regression Analysis**</br>
  * Linear Regression: In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). 
## Evaluation 
In order to evaluate the performance of the model, three evaluation metrics:-</br>
1. Mean Absolute Error, 
2. Mean Squared Error and 
2. Root mean squared error
